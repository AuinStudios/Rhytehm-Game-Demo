# Rhytehm Game Demo
 
## (11/06/2021)
### i am takeing a  break from my first person game and i decided to make an rhythem game where u hit notes i only spendeda  day on it so far its 40 percent done for the  collide system and theres more stuff i wanan add so it might take a month or two to finish this game 


## (16/06/2021)
###  made the input system code  moer efficent and removed the code from the arrows and to the borders because it was insanely inefficent because if u where on a  hard song with like 2000 notes each note would have a   script and thats inefficent so i fixed that but im trying to fix the missing  note thing which right now im to lazy to finish so  im doing it torromow or some other day


## (24/06/2021)
### im lazy this month but i managed to finish the  missing system and added some effects when u hit it and  an effect when u get a  50 combo streak



1) im gonna  take  a break from this game because i dont know how to chart the game
